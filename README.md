#  Airline Booking Test Automation Framework

This project is a Selenium-based test automation framework developed in **Java** using **Maven** and IntelliJ IDEA. It simulates a few critical user flows for an airline booking application, such as **flight search and login validation**.

The structure follows best practices with separation of concerns (Page classes, utilities, and tests), reusable components, and is suitable for CI/CD via Jenkins.
